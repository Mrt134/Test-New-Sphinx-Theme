The goal of this project is to rebuild the trueos_style sphinx theme from the rtd_theme,
 just in a more efficient and organized manner.

Git clone https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme

cp sphinx_rtd_theme > Test New Sphinx Theme/

Build dummy sphinx project: sphinx-quickstart

add test.rst to test custom .css rules from trueos_style.
